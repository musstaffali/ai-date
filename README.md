# Bare-Bones Hotel Booking Web App (For Educational Purposes)

Welcome to the Bare-Bones Hotel Booking Web App! This project serves as a simple starting point for learning and experimenting with React. It's intentionally minimalistic, allowing you to use your imagination and creativity to build upon it and add more features.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide beginners with a basic understanding of how to structure a React application. It covers essential concepts such as components, state management using hooks, and rendering data. However, it intentionally leaves room for you to expand and customize it to suit your needs and interests.

## Features

- Displays a list of hotels with sample data.
- Allows users to make reservations (reservation logic is currently simulated with an alert).
- Provides a foundation for further development.
