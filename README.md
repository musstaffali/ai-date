Step 2: Create a list of hotels as local data
Inside your project folder, open the src directory and create a new file named data.js. In this file, define an array of hotels with some sample data.

Step 3: Build a Hotel component
Create a new file named Hotel.js inside the src directory. In this file, build a functional component to display hotel information.

Step 4: Create a Booking component
Create a new file named Booking.js inside the src directory. This component will allow users to make reservations.

Step 5: Implement state management using React hooks
In the src/App.js file, you can use React hooks to manage the state and render the Hotel and Booking components.

Step 6: Connect the components and render the data
Run the application with npm start, and you should see a basic hotel booking webpage with information about each hotel and the ability to make reservations.
